<h1> Kubetnetes-object </h1>

The Kubernetes Platform contains control over the resources related to Storage and Compute

There are five types of Object model:
<ol>
  <li>Namespace</li>
  <li>POD</li>
  <li>Replicaset</li>
  <li>Deployment</li>
  <li>Service</li>
</ol>


<h3>NameSpace:</h3>
Namespaces are a way to organize clusters into virtual sub-clusters â€” they can be helpful when different teams or projects share a Kubernetes cluster. Any number of namespaces are supported within a cluster, each logically separated from others but with the ability to communicate with each other. Any resource that exists within Kubernetes exists either in the default namespace or a namespace that is created by the cluster operator. Only nodes and persistent storage volumes exist outside of the namespace; these low-level resources are always visible to every namespace in the cluster.

<h3>PODS</h3>
PODS Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.
A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod's contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context.

<h3>Replica Set</h3>
Replica Set A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods. A ReplicaSet is defined with fields, including a selector that specifies how to identify Pods it can acquire, a number of replicas indicating how many Pods it should be maintaining, and a pod template specifying the data of new Pods it should create to meet the number of replicas criteria. A ReplicaSet then fulfills its purpose by creating and deleting Pods as needed to reach the desired number. When a ReplicaSet needs to create new Pods, it uses its Pod template.

<h3>Deployment</h3>
Deployment A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.


<h3>Services</h3>
Service An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.
